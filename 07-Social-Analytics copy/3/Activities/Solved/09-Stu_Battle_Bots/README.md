## Tweet battle

It's time for our to start creating your own army of bots!

## Instructions

First make sure you have created a second twitter account that you have the credentials for. You should now have two twitter accounts.

Create two different scripts that will have your two bots talking to each other.

Each bot should have about 4 response lines that will correspond with what the other bot tweets.

For example

```
bot1: @bot2 Hey!
bot2: @bot1 How are you?
bot1: @bot2 Good! Any weekend plans?
bot2: @bot1 Just watching football!
```
The bots should tweet back about a minute apart.
