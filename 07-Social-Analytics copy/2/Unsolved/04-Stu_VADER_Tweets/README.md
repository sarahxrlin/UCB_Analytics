### Instructions

* You will analyze a total for 200 tweets (how many tweets are on a page?).

* You will need to store the different sentiments in their own list.

* The results will print our the user's name and the mean of the following.

  * Negative.

### Bonus

* Compare the analysis to two other twitter accounts.

* Feel free to use accounts of your own but remember you need to have at least 200 tweets.

* If you don't have an account or enough tweets, try using "@RealDonaldtrump" and "@Katyperry"
