# Popular Twitter Accounts

## Instructions

* In this activity, you are given an incomplete CSV file of Twitter's most popular accounts. You will use this CSV file in conjunction with Tweepy's API to create a pandas DataFrame.

* Consult the Jupyter Notebook file for instructions, but here are your tasks:

* The "PopularAccounts.csv" file has columns whose info needs to be filled in.

* Create a pandas DataFrame and import the CSV file into it.

* Call Tweepy's API to retrieve the info for the missing columns in the starter CSV.

* Export the results to a new CSV file called "PopularAccounts_New.csv"

* Calculate the averages of a user's tweets, # of followers, etc., then create a DataFrame of the averages.
