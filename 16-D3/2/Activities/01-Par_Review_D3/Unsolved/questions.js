// Answer the following questions after discussing with a partner.

/* 1. What does SVG stand for?  How are they used with D3? */
Scalable Vector Graphics is an XML-based vector image format for two-dimensional graphics with support for interactivity and animation. 
The SVG specification is an open standard developed by the World Wide Web Consortium since 1999.


/* 2.  What is data binding? */


/* 3.  Given the following and a an HTML page with no elements currently in the body,
use the enter pattern to render three <li> elements to the page with text matching
the integers in the array. */

// var arr = [1, 2, 3]
var ul = d3.select("body").append("ul")
//YOUR CODE HERE//


/* 4. Imagine three <li> elements already exists on the page.  Create code to update the text of that element while also adding three new elements
to match the array below. */
var arr = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
var ul = d3.select("ul")
// YOUR CODE HERE //


/* Bonus - Make the code in number 4 more concise by using the ES6 syntax for arrow functions.  Then, modify the code to set the text of each
element to "(index in the array): (item from the array) */
// YOUR CODE HERE //
